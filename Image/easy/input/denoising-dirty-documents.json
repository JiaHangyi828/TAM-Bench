The submission file must include a header row. 4. Must use features such as pixel intensity, position (row and column), and image id for modeling. 5. A convolutional neural network (CNN) or similar model specialized in image processing is recommended for this task. 6. Model parameters such as learning rate, number of layers, kernel size, and activation functions should be tuned for optimal performance."
