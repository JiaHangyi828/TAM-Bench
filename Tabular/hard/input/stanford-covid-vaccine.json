  "special_instructions": "1. Only predict values for the first 'seq_scored' positions, though predictions for all positions in the sequence must be included in the submission file. 2. Use features such as 'sequence', 'structure', and 'predicted_loop_type' as they are critical for accurate predictions. 3. Consider methods for handling noise or poor signal-to-noise measurements in the training data, especially since some samples may have negative values or low signal-to-noise ratios. 4. While no specific model type is required, ensure that your approach can handle regression tasks effectively. 5. Ensure predictions align with the experimental conditions described: reactivity, deg_Mg_pH10, and deg_Mg_50C are scored, while deg_pH10 and deg_50C are required but not scored."
