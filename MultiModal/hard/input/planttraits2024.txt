Integrate all ancillary geodata (WORLDCLIM_BIO[*], SOIL_[*], MODIS_[*]/VOD_[*]) to supplement plant photographs. 3. Use response-based data augmentation during training by incorporating the standard deviation of traits (X[*]_sd). 4. Consider using model ensembles with different CNN backbones to improve performance. 5. The evaluation metric is the mean $R^2$ over all 6 traits, with only $R^2$ values > 0 considered."
